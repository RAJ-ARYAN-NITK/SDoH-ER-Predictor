## What This Project Does

Unemployment is not just an economic problem — it is a public health crisis. When unemployment rises in a county, emergency room visits spike, mental health crises increase, and preventive care gets skipped. This project treats unemployment rate as a **SDOH stress indicator** and forecasts it 1 month ahead using economic features, giving public health planners early warning of demand surges.

The model ingests 10 years of monthly employment, inflation, and labor force data across 11 Massachusetts counties and outputs county-specific unemployment forecasts with SHAP-based explanations of which economic factors are driving stress in each region.

## Results

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|-------|-----|------|-----|
| **XGBoost** | **0.0325** | **0.0402** | **0.9998** |
| LSTM | 0.0961 | 0.1351 | 0.9974 |

XGBoost outperforms LSTM by **3x on MAE** — demonstrating that gradient boosting outperforms deep learning on structured tabular time-series with moderate data size. Both models successfully capture the two major unemployment spikes (COVID-19 2020, subsequent surge) and recovery patterns.

**Key SHAP finding:** `medical_care_affordability` (ratio of medical CPI to overall CPI) is the strongest leading indicator of unemployment stress — ahead of energy costs and labor force participation rate. This suggests that healthcare cost inflation precedes employment deterioration in Massachusetts counties.

## Data Sources

All data was manually downloaded from the **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** at `bls.gov`.

### How the data was collected

#### Employment & Unemployment Data
1. Go to `bls.gov` → **Data Tools** → **County Employment and Wages (QCEW)**
2. Select **Massachusetts** → choose each county individually
3. Select **All Industries**, **All Establishment Sizes**, **Total Covered**
4. Download as Excel (.xlsx) for years 2014–2024
5. Repeat for all 11 counties:
   - Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Essex
   - Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, Worcester

#### Inflation / CPI Data
1. Go to `bls.gov` → **Data Tools** → **CPI Databases**
2. Select **All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)** for **Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH**
3. Select series for:
   - `CUURA103SA0` — All Items
   - `CUURA103SAH` — Housing
   - `CUURA103SAE` — Energy
   - `CUURA103SAM` — Medical Care
4. Download as Excel for 2014–2024

#### Manual Merging Process
- Opened each county Excel file and standardized column names
- Added a `region` column with the full county identifier
- Merged all county files into `sdoh_dataset_employment_inflation.csv`
- Separately downloaded unemployment rate series and merged into `sdoh_dataset_with_unemployment.csv`
- Final merge and cleaning was done in `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` → saved as `with_unemployment_processed.csv`

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Data Collection
Download Excel files from BLS for each county and each CPI series. Standardize column names manually in Excel. Save as CSVs in `data/raw/`.

### Step 2 — EDA and Merging
Run `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` to:
- Load both raw CSVs
- Standardize column names
- Merge on date + region
- Handle missing values with IQR capping
- Save `with_unemployment_processed.csv`

### Step 3 — Feature Engineering
Run `backend/ml/data_preprocessing.py` to:
- Shorten region names to county name only
- Create time features (month_sin, month_cos, quarter cyclical encoding)
- Create lag features (lag 1, 3, 6, 12 months)
- Create rolling statistics (mean and std for 3, 6, 12 month windows)
- Engineer SDOH ratios (medical_care_affordability, housing_energy_ratio)
- Build 36-month LSTM sequences
- Scale with StandardScaler
- Save `X_sequences.npy`, `y_target.npy`, `regions.npy`

### Step 4 — Model Training
Run `backend/ml/model_training.py` to:
- Split each county 70/15/15 chronologically (per-county to ensure all counties appear in test set)
- Train XGBoost (500 trees, early stopping, MAE metric)
- Train LSTM (64→32 units, dropout, early stopping)
- Compare both models and save results
- Save `xgb_model.pkl`, `er_lstm_model.keras`, `regions_test.npy`

### Step 5 — Analysis
Run `backend/ml/analysis.py` to:
- Generate per-county true vs predicted plots
- Compute SHAP values (200 sample subset for speed)
- Save SHAP summary and waterfall charts
- Save model comparison bar charts

### Step 6 — Dashboard
Run `streamlit run app.py` to launch the interactive dashboard locally, or deploy to Streamlit Cloud.

    F --> H[Shows exactly which\nfeatures pushed this\nprediction up or down]
    G --> I[Resume insight:\nHealthcare cost inflation\nprecedes unemployment\nstress by 1-3 quarters]
```

**Key SHAP insight:** `medical_care_affordability` ranks as the strongest leading predictor of unemployment stress — ahead of energy costs and labor force participation rate. Healthcare cost inflation precedes employment deterioration by 1–3 quarters in Massachusetts counties.
